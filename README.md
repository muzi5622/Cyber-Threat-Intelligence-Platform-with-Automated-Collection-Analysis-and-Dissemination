# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform (CTI)
**Automated Collection, ML-Driven Analysis, Strategic Decision-Making, and Secure Intelligence Sharing**

Enterprise-grade Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform that automates the full intelligence lifecycle — from OSINT and honeypot collection to machine-learning attribution, executive decision support, and secure STIX/TAXII intelligence sharing.

Built around OpenCTI, Elasticsearch, and custom ML pipelines.

---

# 📌 Overview

This platform implements a complete intelligence pipeline:

```

Collection → Enrichment → Attribution → Correlation → Strategic Decision → Dissemination

```

It transforms raw threat data into:

- Structured CTI
- Threat actor attribution
- Executive-level risk reports
- Actionable BLOCK / MONITOR / IGNORE decisions
- Secure partner intelligence feeds

---

# 🚀 Key Features

## Automated Intelligence Collection

- RSS threat intelligence ingestion
- AlienVault OTX integration
- URLHaus malicious URL ingestion
- MITRE ATT&CK integration
- Honeypot log ingestion via Logstash → Elasticsearch

---

## IOC Extraction and Enrichment

### Rule-based NLP extraction

Extracts:

- IPv4 / IPv6
- Domains
- URLs
- MD5 / SHA1 / SHA256 hashes
- CVEs

### ML-based NER extraction

Transformer model:

```

muzi5622/cti-ner-model

```

Provides:

- Context-aware IOC extraction
- Improved accuracy over regex
- Label-based enrichment

---

## ML-Based Threat Actor Attribution (Honeypot Intelligence)

Uses honeypot logs to automatically:

- Profile attacker behavior
- Classify attackers (scanner, botnet, bruteforce)
- Cluster attackers
- Create Threat Actor entities in OpenCTI
- Link Indicators → Threat Actors

Model source:

```

muzi5622/actor-profiler-model

```

---

## Strategic Decision Engine

Automatically generates executive reports:

- Daily Executive Cyber Brief
- Weekly Cyber Risk Brief
- Monthly Risk Assessment

Provides automated decisions:

```

BLOCK
MONITOR
IGNORE

```

Based on:

- Threat severity
- Confidence
- Recency
- Intelligence correlation

API available at:

```

```

---

## Secure Intelligence Sharing (STIX 2.1 / TAXII-style)

Exports intelligence into:

- Public feeds
- Partner feeds
- Internal feeds

Supports:

- API key authentication
- TLP classification (CLEAR, AMBER, RED)
- Partner-specific filtering
- Intelligence sanitization
